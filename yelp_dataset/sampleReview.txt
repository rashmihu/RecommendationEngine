"text":"A voucher deal is always a good way to get introduced to new venues and restaurants. Twenty Princes Street is one of the places we never really thought of visiting.  - It actually has one of the 2 only Josper Grills in Edinburgh (the Black Room has the other one) \nIt shares the building of an hotel and Juniper Fondue is on the same floor. The entrance is quite decorative, candles in lanterns placed on the carpeted stairs and a great parquet flooring at the reception. \n\nThe restaurant has several booths and mixes 2-4 seater tables in the middle of the room. It overlooks the Balmoral and the Mount. Quite a sight at night. Possibly even better during Christmas on Princes Street.  \n\nWe were shown our table and our coats were taken to be hung. Looking around it suddenly occurred to me that the flooring (short parqueted) is extremely suited for dancing (no I didn't). This notion made me look at the way the tables were placed and it just looked like a dance\/ ballroom floor flanked by private booths and with tables added to be swiftly removed when the band starts playing.  Great place for a wedding, not so for a restaurant. It felt like a posh pop-up restaurant. \n\nThe service though efficient, was a little lacklustre. No real attention was given to the presentation on the table . \nWe were invited to get a drink and we took a glass of Shiraz and Innes & Gunn. \nWe got our Bread & Butter and I decided on a starter. Pigeon Breast and Pear with a 'granola' of hazelnut crumble and pistachios. \nThis was very nice, well presented and that 'granola' worked very well. Very enjoyable.\n\nThe deal was for a Josper Oven Grilled Rib-eye Steak with Triple Cooked Fries and a sauce of our choice. \nI chose the Peppercorn and Anita had her Bearnaise. Both steaks were cooked medium rare and came out as expected. However we got potato wedges and not fries (which technically are potatoes too, granted) and my Peppercorn Sauce was a jus with some black peppercorns. Again technically correct. \n\nIt just wasn't exciting, not very tasty. I wasn't looking for outstanding, I didn't need to be wowed. I was not very .. eh.. whelmed with the dish on my plate. Steak was juicy, though lacking the promised chargrilled flavour I was expecting. \n\nThe location and view is stunning, service was allright. The starters are delicious their steak mains less so. \nA solid 3 stars.",
